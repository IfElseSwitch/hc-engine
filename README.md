# HC Engine

## What is HC Engine?
HC Engine is a C# library which provides a simple way to interpret a customisable scripting language.
HC Engine allows to change any keyword, and extend its tools to allow for more complex (or simpler) scripts.

## What is HC Engine for?
The main goal of HC Engine is to provide a simple way to interpret user commands. 
If you want to let your software's user to customise some of your application's behavior, it might be the tool for the task.

## How to integrate HC Engine in your application
First, you have to reference the HC Engine Dll in your project.
Then, you'll have to declare what calls the user can use by implementing an interface, and finally, run the user script through the engine.
Optionnally, you can change language keywords, add or remove section types, and add new data types by marking your types in code with an attribute.
